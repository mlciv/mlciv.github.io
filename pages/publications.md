## Research Overview

My research is primarily focused on **Natural Language Processing**, particularly in the area of **Dialogue** and **Structured Prediction**. As AI challenges become more complex, I'm keen on developing modularized AI systems tailored for future large-scale projects that demand Human-AI Teaming, which requires complex *control, reasoning, collaboration, and adaptation*.

- **Modularized NLP.** To decompose and integrate submodules~(e.g., structured knowledge, mixture of experts, multi-modalities) into controllable AI systems, my research spans symbolic language representations, neuro-symbolic interfaces, which have been applied to *deep linguistic structured prediction* from sentence to dialogue~([Dissertation'22](https://www.proquest.com/docview/2777357718?pq-origsite=gscholar&fromopenview=true),
           [CoNLL'19](https://aclanthology.org/K19-2013/),
           [ACL'19](https://aclanthology.org/P19-1563/),
           [NAACL'21](https://aclanthology.org/2021.naacl-main.62/),
           [IWSDS'23](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12944)), controllable generation with constraints ([DSTC7'19](http://workshop.colips.org/dstc7/papers/13.pdf), [ACL'19](https://aclanthology.org/P19-1192/),[BEA'23](https://aclanthology.org/2023.bea-1.47/)).
- **Controllable Learning.** I investigated *foundational models that integrating data-driven with various inductive biases*, which are critical for creating efficient and trustworthy AI systems~(especially for Education and Health). I studied graph-based parsing via latent anchoring analysis([CoNLL'19](https://aclanthology.org/K19-2013)),
      tree-structure database query plan characterization via self-supervised contrastive learning ([VLDB'22](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.14778/3503585.3503600)),
      zero-shot dialogue state tracking via description-driven
      learning and supplementary pretraining ([NAACL'21](https://aclanthology.org/2021.naacl-main.62/)), and LLM prompting and finetuning ([L@S'24](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3657604.366466://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/36576043664664)), etc. 
- **Robust Deployment.** I studied language modeling under the complex environment of the real world, such as distribution shift([ACL'23](https://aclanthology.org/2023.acl-short.156)), unnoticed non-verbal behavior ([AIAIC'23](https://aichildinteraction.github.io/preprint/AIAIC23_paper_7399.pdf)), noisy speech in small-group classroom ([UMAP'23](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3565472.3595606)),
      multi-party, multi-modal dynamics ([IWSDS'23](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12944)),
      and robust evaluations with conversational simulation.
