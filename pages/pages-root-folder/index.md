Jie Cao is an Assitant Professor in the School of Computer Science at the
University of Oklahoma. Before joining OU, he spent two years as a post-doctoral researcher at the NSF AI Institute for Student-AI Teaming ([iSAT](https://www.colorado.edu/research/ai-institute/)) at the University of Colorado Boulder, where he mainly worked with <a href="https://home.cs.colorado.edu/~martin/">James Martin</a> and <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/faculty/palmer-martha/">Martha Palmer</a>. He obtained my Ph.D. from the <a href="https://cs.utah.edu/">Kahlert School of Computing</a> at the <a href="https://www.utah.edu">University of Utah</a>, where he worked with <a href="https://svivek.com">Vivek Srikumar</a>. Previously, he completed his M.S. and B.S. in Computer Science from Huazhong University of Science of Technology in China, and he has also worked/interned in industrial companies including Alibaba, Baidu, WeChat, and Amazon, etc.

# Research Interests
I work on **Natural Language Processing** and **Machine Learning**. Current interests include:
- Controllable Multi-party Multi-modal Dialogue, and its application on Mental Health, Education, etc
- Structured Prediction and Neuro-Symbolic Methods for Modularized NLP
- Efficient Prompt Optimization and Post-training of Large Language Model
