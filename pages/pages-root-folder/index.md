# Research Interests

My research is primarily focused on **Natural Language Processing**, particularly in the area of **Dialogue** and **Structured Prediction**.
- **Modularized NLP.** As AI challenges become increasingly complex, I'm keen on developing modularized AI systems tailored for future large-scale projects with more collaboration and uncertainties. My research spans formal language representation, neuro-symbolic interfaces, and ensuring differentiability while decomposing and integrating submodules like LLMs into a cohesive AI system. This includes deep structured prediction ([Dissertation'22](https://www.proquest.com/docview/2777357718?pq-origsite=gscholar&fromopenview=true),
           [CoNLL'19](https://aclanthology.org/K19-2013/),
           [ACL'19](https://aclanthology.org/P19-1563/),
           [NAACL'21](https://aclanthology.org/2021.naacl-main.62/),
           [IWSDS'23](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12944)), controllable generation with constraints ([DSTC7'19](http://workshop.colips.org/dstc7/papers/13.pdf), [ACL'19](https://aclanthology.org/P19-1192/),[BEA'23](https://aclanthology.org/2023.bea-1.47/)).
- **Learning with Minimal Supervision.** In practical applications, we often have limited supervision because data is scarce, high-quality annotations are time-consuming, and trial-and-error verification are expensive. I investigate *foundational structures and principles*, both within and beyond language, which are critical for creating efficient and reliable AI systems, especially in domains like Education and Health. I studied graph-based parsing via latent anchoring analysis([CoNLL'19](https://aclanthology.org/K19-2013)),
      tree-structure database query plan characterization via self-supervised contrastive learning ([VLDB'22](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.14778/3503585.3503600)),
      zero-shot dialogue state tracking via description-driven
      learning and supplementary pretraining ([NAACL'21](https://aclanthology.org/2021.naacl-main.62/)), and LLM finetuning ([L@S'24](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3657604.366466://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/36576043664664)), etc.
- **Deployment in Real-world Scenarios.** The complex environment of the real world often makes our model fall short when faced with different input distributions ([ACL'23](https://aclanthology.org/2023.acl-short.156)), uncertain conversational dynamics, unnoticed non-verbal behavior ([AIAIC'23](https://aichildinteraction.github.io/preprint/AIAIC23_paper_7399.pdf)), noisy speech in small-group classroom ([UMAP'23](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3565472.3595606)),
      multi-party, multi-modal dynamics ([IWSDS'23](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12944)),
      and conversational simulation.
