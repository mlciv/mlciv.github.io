# Research Interests
To maintain robustness and control in adopting advanced black-box
neural technologies, such as foundation models, domain-specific
conversational systems can gain advantages from employing
interpretable modular designs. This involves breaking down tasks into
logically abstracted or theory-grounded sub-modules aligned with our
desired level of control. My research focues on addressing the challenges:
- **Modularized NLP.** To connect each module and make a coherent
          system, my research studies *deep structured prediction* for
          extracting symbolic representations from text
          ([Dissertation'22](https://www.proquest.com/docview/2777357718?pq-origsite=gscholar&fromopenview=true),
          [CoNLL'19](https://aclanthology.org/K19-2013/),
          [ACL'19](https://aclanthology.org/P19-1563/),
          [NAACL'21](https://aclanthology.org/2021.naacl-main.62/),
          [IWSDS'23](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12944)) and
          *controllable generation* with augmented-memory, symbolic or
          neural-symbolic constraints
          ([DSTC7'19](http://workshop.colips.org/dstc7/papers/13.pdf), [ACL'19](https://aclanthology.org/P19-1192/),
          [BEA'23](https://aclanthology.org/2023.bea-1.47/)).
- **Learning with Inductive Biases.** Beyond the expensive supervised data in many domains~(e.g.,
          psychotherapy, teaching, tutoring, small-group collaboration), we investigate learning with domain-specific knowledges as inductive biases, such as graph-based parsing via anchoring analysis([CoNLL'19](https://aclanthology.org/K19-2013)),
      database workload characterization via self-supervised learning([VLDB'22](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.14778/3503585.3503600)),
      zero-shot dialogue state tracking via description-driven
      learning and supplementary pretraining([NAACL'21](https://aclanthology.org/2021.naacl-main.62/)).
- **Deployment in Real-world Scenarios.** Unexpected,
      complex dialogue scenarios can potentially span infinitely many
      topics, states and environmental settings([ACL'23](https://aclanthology.org/2023.acl-short.156)). We study
      robustness issues when deploying dialogue system in our daily
      life, such as in-classroom AI partner([AIAIC'23](https://aichildinteraction.github.io/preprint/AIAIC23_paper_7399.pdf)),
      noisy speech~([UMAP'23](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3565472.3595606)),
      multi-party, multi-modal dynamics ([IWSDS'23](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12944)),
      and conversational simulation.
